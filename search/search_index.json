This new feature has a number of benefits, especially when you need to handle complex dependencies in forms/fieldsets. Short names The first advantage of pulling form elements from the service manager is that now you can use short names to create new elements through the factory. Therefore, this code: $form->add([ 'type' => Element\\Email::class, 'name' => 'email', ]); can now be replaced by: $form->add([ 'type' => 'Email', 'name' => 'email' ]); Each element provided out-of-the-box by laminas-form supports this natively. Use the ::class constant While using aliases leads to compact code, they're also can more easily result in typographic mistakes. We recommend using the ::class constant in most situations, as these can be more easily scanned with static analysis tools for correctness. Creating custom elements laminas-form also supports custom form elements. To create a custom form element, make it extend the Laminas\\Form\\Element class, or, if you have a more specific dependency, extend one of the classes in the Laminas\\Form\\Element namespace. In the following, we will demonstrate creating a custom Phone element for entering phone numbers. It will extend Laminas\\Form\\Element class and provide some default input rules. Our custom phone element could look something like this: namespace Application\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Filter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Validator\\Regex as RegexValidator; class Phone extends Element implements InputProviderInterface { /** * @var ValidatorInterface */ protected $validator; /** * Get a validator if none has been set. * * @return ValidatorInterface */ public function getValidator() { if (null === $this->validator) { $validator = new RegexValidator('/^\\+?\\d{11,12}$/'); $validator->setMessage( 'Please enter 11 or 12 digits only!', RegexValidator::NOT_MATCH ); $this->validator = $validator; } return $this->validator; } /** * Sets the validator to use for this element * * @param ValidatorInterface $validator * @return self */ public function setValidator(ValidatorInterface $validator) { $this->validator = $validator; return $this; } /** * Provide default input rules for this element * * Attaches a phone number validator. * * @return array */ public function getInputSpecification() { return [ 'name' => $this->getName(), 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ], 'validators' => [ $this->getValidator(), ], ]; } } By implementing Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface interface, we are hinting to our form object that this element provides some default input rules for filtering and/or validating values. In this example, the default input specification provides a Laminas\\Filter\\StringTrim filter and a Laminas\\Validator\\Regex validator that validates that the value optionally has a + sign at the beginning, and is followed by 11 or 12 digits. To use the new element in our forms, we can specify it by its fully qualified class name (FQCN): use Application\\Form\\Element\\Phone; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; $form = Form(); $form->add(array( 'name' => 'phone', 'type' => Phone::class, )); Or, if you are extending Laminas\\Form\\Form : namespace Application\\Form; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class MyForm extends Form { public function __construct($name = null) { parent::__construct($name); $this->add([ 'name' => 'phone', 'type' => Element\\Phone::class, ]); } } If you don't want to use the custom element's FQCN, but rather a short name, add an entry for it to Laminas\\Form\\FormElementManager . You can do this by adding an entry under the form_elements configuration, or within your Module class via a getFormElementConfig() method. Configuration via a config file (e.g., module.config.php ) file looks like the following: use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Factory\\InvokableFactory; return [ 'form_elements' => [ 'aliases' => [ 'phone' => Application\\Form\\Element\\Phone::class, ], 'factories' => [ Application\\Form\\Element\\Phone::class => InvokableFactory::class, ], ], ]; The following demonstrates using your Module class: namespace Application; use Laminas\\ModuleManager\\Feature\\FormElementProviderInterface; use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Factory\\InvokableFactory; class Module implements FormElementProviderInterface { public function getFormElementConfig() { return [ 'aliases' => [ 'phone' => Form\\Element\\Phone::class, ], 'factories' => [ Form\\Element\\Phone::class => InvokableFactory::class, ], ]; } } If needed, you can define a custom factory for handling dependencies. And now comes the first catch. If you are creating your form class by extending Laminas\\Form\\Form , you must not add the custom element in the constructor (as we have done in the previous example where we used the custom element's FQCN), but rather in the init() method: namespace Application\\Form; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class MyForm extends Form { public function init() { $this->add([ 'name' => 'phone', 'type' => 'phone', ]); } } The second catch is that you must not directly instantiate your form class, but rather get an instance of it through Laminas\\Form\\FormElementManager : namespace Application\\Controller; use Application\\Form\\MyForm; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; class IndexController extends AbstractActionController { private $form; public function __construct(MyForm $form) { $this->form = $form; } public function indexAction() { return array('form' => $this->form); } } This now requires a factory to inject the form instance: namespace Application\\Controller; use Interop\\Container\\ContainerInterface; use Application\\Form\\MyForm; class IndexControllerFactory { public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container) { $formManager = $container->get('FormElementManager'); return new IndexController($formManager->get(MyForm::class)); } } Which in turn requires that you map the controller to the factory: // In module.config.php return [ /* ... */ 'controllers' => [ 'factories' => [ Application\\Controller\\IndexController::class => Application\\Controller\\IndexControllerFactory::class, ], ], ]; The biggest gain of this is that you can easily override any built-in form elements if they do not fit your needs. For instance, if you want to create your own Email element instead of the standard one, create your custom element, and add it to the form element config with the same key as the element you want to replace: namespace Application; use Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Email; use Laminas\\ModuleManager\\Feature\\FormElementProviderInterface; use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Factory\\InvokableFactory; class Module implements FormElementProviderInterface { public function getFormElementConfig() { return [ 'aliases' => [ 'email' => Form\\Element\\MyEmail::class, 'Email' => Form\\Element\\MyEmail::class, ], 'factories' => [ Form\\Element\\MyEmail::class => InvokableFactory::class, ], ]; } } Now whenever you create an element with a type of 'email', it will create the custom element instead of the built-in one. Use the original? If you want to be able to use both the built-in one and your own one, you can still provide the FQCN of the element, e.g. Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Email . In summary, to create your own form elements (or even reusable fieldsets!) and be able to use them in your form, you need to: Create your element (like you did before). Add it to the form element manager either via the form_elements configuration in your module, or by defining a getFormElementConfig() in your Module class. Make sure the custom form element is not added in the form's constructor, but rather in its init() method, or after getting an instance of the form. Retrieve your form through the form element manager instead of directly instantiating it, and inject it in your controller. Handling dependencies Dependency management can be complex. For instance, a very frequent use case is a form that creates a fieldset, but itself need access to the database to populate a Select element. Retrieving forms from the FormElementManager solves this issue, as factories it invokes have access to the application service container, and can use it to provide dependencies. For instance, let's say that a form create a fieldset called AlbumFieldset : namespace Application\\Form; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class CreateAlbum extends Form { public function init() { $this->add([ 'name' => 'album', 'type' => AlbumFieldset::class, ]); } } Let's now create the AlbumFieldset , and have it depend on an AlbumTable object that allows us to fetch albums from the database. namespace Application\\Form; use Album\\Model\\AlbumTable; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; class AlbumFieldset extends Fieldset { public function __construct(AlbumTable $albumTable) { // Add any elements that need to fetch data from database // using the album table ! } } To enable this, we'll create a factory for our AlbumFieldset as follows: namespace Application\\Form; use Album\\Model\\AlbumTable; use Interop\\Container\\ContainerInterface; use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\FactoryInterface; use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\ServiceLocatorInterface; class AlbumFieldsetFactory implements FactoryInterface { public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, $name, array $options = null) { return new AlbumFieldset($container->get(AlbumTable::class)); } public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $formManager) { return $this( $formManager->getServiceLocator() ?: $formManager, AlbumFieldset::class ); } } Compatibility The above factory was written to work with both the v2 and v3 releases of laminas-servicemanager. If you know you will only be using v3, you can remove the createService() implementation. You can now map the fieldset to the factory in your configuration: // In module.config.php: return [ 'form_elements' => [ 'factories' => [ Application\\Form\\AlbumFieldset::class => Application\\Form\\AlbumFieldsetFactory::class, ], ], ]; Inject your form into your controller, per the example in the previous section. As a reminder, to use your fieldset in a view, you need to use the formCollection helper: echo $this->form()->openTag($form); echo $this->formCollection($form->get('album')); echo $this->form()->closeTag(); Initialization As noted in previous sections, and in the chapter on elements, we recommend defining an init() method for initializing your elements, fieldsets, and forms. Where does this come from, and when exactly is it invoked in the object lifecycle? The method is defined in Laminas\\Stdlib\\InitializableInterface , which Laminas\\Form\\Element implements. It is not , however, automatically invoked on instantiation! Within laminas-form, the FormElementManager defines an initializer that is pushed to the bottom of the initializer stack, making it the last initializer invoked. This initializer checks if the instance created implements InitializableInterface , and, if so, calls its init() method. This approach ensures that dependencies are fully injected prior to any methods you call from your init() method. As a result, when pulling items from the FormElementManager , you can be assured that all factories are correctly setup and populated, and shared across all specifications you provide.","title":"Advanced"},{"location":"advanced/#advanced-use-cases","text":"Beginning with version 2.1, forms elements can be registered using a designated plugin manager, in the same way that view helpers, controller plugins, and filters are registered.

In some cases, they may correspond to collections of domain objects. In this latter case, in terms of user interfaces, you may want to add items dynamically in the user interface \u2014 a great example is adding tasks to a task list. This document is intended to demonstrate these features. To do so, we first need to define some domain objects that we'll be using. namespace Application\\Entity; class Product { /** * @var string */ protected $name; /** * @var int */ protected $price; /** * @var Brand */ protected $brand; /** * @var array */ protected $categories; /** * @param string $name * @return self */ public function setName($name) { $this->name = $name; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getName() { return $this->name; } /** * @param int $price * @return self */ public function setPrice($price) { $this->price = $price; return $this; } /** * @return int */ public function getPrice() { return $this->price; } /** * @param Brand $brand * @return self */ public function setBrand(Brand $brand) { $this->brand = $brand; return $this; } /** * @return Brand */ public function getBrand() { return $this->brand; } /** * @param Category[] $categories * @return self */ public function setCategories(array $categories) { $this->categories = $categories; return $this; } /** * @return Category[] */ public function getCategories() { return $this->categories; } } class Brand { /** * @var string */ protected $name; /** * @var string */ protected $url; /** * @param string $name * @return self */ public function setName($name) { $this->name = $name; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getName() { return $this->name; } /** * @param string $url * @return self */ public function setUrl($url) { $this->url = $url; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getUrl() { return $this->url; } } class Category { /** * @var string */ protected $name; /** * @param string $name * @return self */ public function setName($name) { $this->name = $name; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getName() { return $this->name; } } A Product has two scalar properties, name and price, a 1:1 relationship (one Product has one Brand ), and a 1:N relationship (one Product has many Category instances). Creating Fieldsets The first step is to create three fieldsets. Each fieldset will contain all the fields and relationships for a specific entity. Here is the Brand fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Brand; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class BrandFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('brand'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Brand()); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the brand', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'url', 'type' => Element\\Url::class, 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Website of the brand', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); } /** * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], ]; } } The fieldset calls the method setHydrator() , giving it a ClassMethods hydrator, and the setObject() method, giving it an empty Brand instance. When we validate incoming data, the form will automatically iterate through all the fieldsets it contains populate all sub-objects, in order to return a complete entity. Notice that the Url element has a type of Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Url . This information will be used to validate the input field. You don't need to manually add filters or validators for this input as that element provides a reasonable input specification. Finally, getInputFilterSpecification() gives the specification for the remaining input (\"name\"), indicating that this input is required. Note that required in the array \"attributes\" (when elements are added) is only meant to add the \"required\" attribute to the form markup (and therefore has semantic meaning only). Here is the Category fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Category; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class CategoryFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('category'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Category()); $this->setLabel('Category'); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the category', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); } /** * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], ]; } } Nothing new here. Finally, the Product fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Product; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class ProductFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('product'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Product()); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the product', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'price', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Price of the product', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => BrandFieldset::class, 'name' => 'brand', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Brand of the product', ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Collection::class, 'name' => 'categories', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please choose categories for this product', 'count' => 2, 'should_create_template' => true, 'allow_add' => true, 'target_element' => [ 'type' => CategoryFieldset::class, ], ], ]); } /** * Should return an array specification compatible with * {@link Laminas\\InputFilter\\Factory::createInputFilter()}. * * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], 'price' => [ 'required' => true, 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => 'Float', ], ], ], ]; } } We have a lot of new things here! First, notice how the brand element is added: we specify it to be of type Application\\Form\\BrandFieldset . This is how you handle a 1:1 relationship. When the form is validated, the BrandFieldset will first be populated, and will return a Brand entity (as we have specified a ClassMethods hydrator, and bound the fieldset to a Brand entity using the setObject() method). This Brand entity will then be used to populate the Product entity by calling the setBrand() method. The next element shows you how to handle 1:N relationships. The type is Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , which is a specialized element to handle such cases. As you can see, the name of the element (\"categories\") perfectly matches the name of the property in the Product entity. This element has a few interesting options: count : this is how many times the element (in this case, a category) has to be rendered. We've set it to 2 in this example. should_create_template : if set to true , it will generate a template markup in a <span> element, in order to simplify adding new element on the fly (we will speak about this one later). allow_add : if set to true (which is the default), dynamically added elements will be retrieved and validated; otherwise, they will be completely ignored. This, of course, depends on what you want to do. target_element : this is either an element or, as this is the case in this example, an array that describes the element or fieldset that will be used in the collection. In this case, the target_element is a Category fieldset. The Form Element So far, so good. We now have our fieldsets in place. But those are fieldsets, not forms. And only Form instances can be validated. So here is the form: namespace Application\\Form; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilter; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class CreateProduct extends Form { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('create_product'); $this->setAttribute('method', 'post') $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setInputFilter(new InputFilter()); $this->add([ 'type' => ProductFieldset::class, 'options' => [ 'use_as_base_fieldset' => true, ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Csrf::class, 'name' => 'csrf', ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'submit', 'attributes' => [ 'type' => 'submit', 'value' => 'Send', ], ]); } } CreateProduct only defines a Product fieldset, as well as some other useful fields ( CSRF for security, and a Submit button). Notice the use_as_base_fieldset option. This option is here to say to the form: \"hey, the object I bind to you is, in fact, bound to the fieldset that is the base fieldset.\" This will be to true in most situations. This approach allows each entity to have its own Fieldset , and enables re-use. You describe the elements, the filters, and validators for each entity only once, and the concrete Form instance will only compose those fieldsets. You no longer have to add the \"username\" input to every form that deals with users! Integrating with laminas-mvc Now, let's create a laminas-mvc controller action: /** * @return array */ public function indexAction() { $form = new CreateProduct(); $product = new Product(); $form->bind($product); $request = $this->getRequest(); if ($request->isPost()) { $form->setData($request->getPost()); if ($form->isValid()) { var_dump($product); } } return [ 'form' => $form, ]; } All the controller does is: Create a form instance. Bind it to an object. Validate it and/or return the form instance for later use by the view. Integration with laminas-view And finally, the view: <?php $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('home')); $form->prepare(); echo $this->form()->openTag($form); $product = $form->get('product'); // The name and price can be rendered as regular elements: echo $this->formRow($product->get('name')); echo $this->formRow($product->get('price')); // Categories are rendered as a collection: echo $this->formCollection($product->get('categories')); $brand = $product->get('brand'); // Since the brand is a 1:1 relationship, its elements are rendered normally: echo $this->formRow($brand->get('name')); echo $this->formRow($brand->get('url')); // And finally, we render the CSRF and submit elements: echo $this->formHidden($form->get('csrf')); echo $this->formElement($form->get('submit')); echo $this->form()->closeTag(); A few new things here : the prepare() method. You must call it prior to rendering anything in the view (this function is only meant to be called in views, not in controllers). the FormRow helper renders a label (if present), the input itself, and errors. the FormCollection helper will iterate through every element in the collection, and render every element with the FormRow helper (you may specify an alternate helper if desired, using the setElementHelper() method on that FormCollection helper instance). If you need more control about the way you render your forms, you can iterate through the elements in the collection, and render them manually one by one. Here is the result: Collections are wrapped inside a fieldset, and every item in the collection is itself wrapped in the fieldset. In fact, the Collection element uses label for each item in the collection, while the label of the Collection element itself is used as the legend of the fieldset . You must have a label on every element in order to use this feature. If you don't want the fieldset created, but just the elements within it, add a boolean false as the second parameter of the FormCollection view helper. If you validate, all elements will show errors (this is normal, as we've marked them as required). As soon as the form is valid, this is what we get : The bound object is completely filled with the object instances we specified, not with arrays! Adding New Elements Dynamically Remember that should_create_template flag? We're going to use it now. Often, forms are not completely static. In our case, let's say that we don't want only two categories, but we want the user to be able to add more at runtime. laminas-form enables this capability. First, let's see what it generates when we ask it to create a template: The collection generates two fieldsets (the two categories) plus a span with a data-template attribute that contains the full HTML code to copy to create a new element in the collection. The value __index__ (this is the placeholder generated) must be changed to a valid value. Currently, we have 2 elements ( categories[0] and categories[1] , so __index__ must be changed to 2. If you want, this placeholder ( __index__ is the default) can be changed using the template_placeholder option key: $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Collection::class, 'name' => 'categories', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please choose categories for this product', 'count' => 2, 'should_create_template' => true, 'template_placeholder' => '__placeholder__', 'target_element' => [ 'type' => CategoryFieldset::class, ], ], ]); First, let's add a small button \"Add new category\" anywhere in the form: <button onclick=\"return add_category()\">Add a new category</button> The add_category function will need to do the following: First, count the number of elements we already have. Get the template from the span 's data-template attribute. Change the placeholder to a valid index. Add the element to the DOM. The following is a potential implementation: function add_category() { var currentCount = $('form > fieldset > fieldset').length; var template = $('form > fieldset > span').data('template'); template = template.replace(/__index__/g, currentCount); $('form > fieldset').append(template); return false; } (Note: the above example assumes $() is defined, and equivalent to jQuery's $() function, Dojo's dojo.query , etc.) One small remark about template.replace : the example uses currentCount and not currentCount + 1 , as the indices are zero-based (so, if we have two elements in the + collection, the third one will have the index 2 ). Now if we validate the form, it will automatically take into account this new element by validating it, filtering it and retrieving it: If you don't want to allow adding elements in a collection, you must set the option allow_add to false . This way, even if new elements are added, they won't be validated and hence, not added to the entity. Also, if we don't want elements to be added, we don't need the data template, either. Here's how you both disable adding dynamic elements, and disable the template: $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Collection::class, 'name' => 'categories', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please choose categories for this product', 'count' => 2, // Do not allow adding: 'allow_add' => false, // Do not display the index template: 'should_create_template' => false, 'target_element' => [ 'type' => CategoryFieldset::class, ], ], ]); There are some limitations to this capability: Although you can add new elements and remove them, you CANNOT remove more elements in a collection than the initial count (for instance, if your code specifies count == 2 , you will be able to add a third one and remove it, but you won't be able to remove any others. If the initial count is 2, you must have at least two elements. Dynamically added elements have to be added at the end of the collection. They can be added anywhere (these elements will still be validated and inserted into the entity), but if the validation fails, this newly added element will be automatically placed at the end of the collection. Validation groups for fieldsets and collection Validation groups allow you to validate a subset of fields. As an example, although the Brand entity has a url property, we don't want the user to specify it in the creation form (but may wish to later in the \"Edit Product\" form, for instance). Let's update the view to remove the url input: <?php $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('home')); $form->prepare(); echo $this->form()->openTag($form); $product = $form->get('product'); echo $this->formRow($product->get('name')); echo $this->formRow($product->get('price')); echo $this->formCollection($product->get('categories')); $brand = $product->get('brand'); echo $this->formRow($brand->get('name')); echo $this->formHidden($form->get('csrf')); echo $this->formElement($form->get('submit')); echo $this->form()->closeTag(); This is what we get: The url input has disappeared, but even if we fill every input, the form won't validate. In fact, this is normal. We specified in the input filter that the url is a required field, so if the form does not have it, it won't validate, even though we didn't add it to the view! Of course, you could create a BrandFieldsetWithoutUrl fieldset, but this would require a lot of duplicate code. The solution: validation groups. A validation group is specified in a Form object (hence, in our case, in the CreateProduct form) by giving an array of all the elements we want to validate. Our CreateProduct class now looks like this: namespace Application\\Form; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilter; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class CreateProduct extends Form { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('create_product'); $this->setAttribute('method', 'post'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator()); $this->setInputFilter(new InputFilter()); $this->add([ 'type' => ProductFieldset::class, 'options' => [ 'use_as_base_fieldset' => true, ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Csrf::class, 'name' => 'csrf', ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'submit', 'attributes' => [ 'type' => 'submit', 'value' => 'Send', ], ]); $this->setValidationGroup([ 'csrf', 'product' => [ 'name', 'price', 'brand' => [ 'name', ], 'categories' => [ 'name', ], ], ]); } } Don't forget to add the CSRF element, as we want it to be validated too (but notice that the example omits the submit element, as we don't care about its value). You can also recursively select the elements if desired. There is one limitation currently: validation groups for collections are set on a per-collection basis, not per-element in a collection basis. This means you cannot say, \"validate the name input for the first element of the categories collection, but don't validate it for the second one.\" Now, the form validates (and the url is set to null as we didn't specify it). Preventing validation from wiping out previous collection items In some cases, you may be representing collections within a model, but not validating them; as an example, if you use a validation group that excludes the collections from validation so that they remain untouched after binding. Starting in 2.8.4, behavior around collections changed in order to fix some underlying bugs. One such change is that if a collection is found in a form, but has no associated data, an empty array is assigned to it, even when not in the validation group. This effectively wipes out the collection data when you bind values. To prevent this behavior, starting in 2.9.1 you may pass an optional second argument to bindValues() on either a fieldset or collection, $validationGroup ; when present, these instances will first check if the collection is in the validation group before binding the value; if it is not, the collection will not be represented. The Form class has been updated to pass the validation group, if present, on to fieldset and collection instances when performing bindValues() operations.

Each fieldset will contain all the fields and relationships for a specific entity. Here is the Brand fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Brand; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class BrandFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('brand'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Brand()); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the brand', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'url', 'type' => Element\\Url::class, 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Website of the brand', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); } /** * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], ]; } } The fieldset calls the method setHydrator() , giving it a ClassMethods hydrator, and the setObject() method, giving it an empty Brand instance. When we validate incoming data, the form will automatically iterate through all the fieldsets it contains populate all sub-objects, in order to return a complete entity. Notice that the Url element has a type of Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Url . This information will be used to validate the input field. You don't need to manually add filters or validators for this input as that element provides a reasonable input specification. Finally, getInputFilterSpecification() gives the specification for the remaining input (\"name\"), indicating that this input is required. Note that required in the array \"attributes\" (when elements are added) is only meant to add the \"required\" attribute to the form markup (and therefore has semantic meaning only). Here is the Category fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Category; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class CategoryFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('category'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Category()); $this->setLabel('Category'); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the category', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); } /** * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], ]; } } Nothing new here. Finally, the Product fieldset: namespace Application\\Form; use Application\\Entity\\Product; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ClassMethods as ClassMethodsHydrator; class ProductFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function __construct() { parent::__construct('product'); $this->setHydrator(new ClassMethodsHydrator(false)); $this->setObject(new Product()); $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Name of the product', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'price', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Price of the product', ], 'attributes' => [ 'required' => 'required', ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => BrandFieldset::class, 'name' => 'brand', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Brand of the product', ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Collection::class, 'name' => 'categories', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please choose categories for this product', 'count' => 2, 'should_create_template' => true, 'allow_add' => true, 'target_element' => [ 'type' => CategoryFieldset::class, ], ], ]); } /** * Should return an array specification compatible with * {@link Laminas\\InputFilter\\Factory::createInputFilter()}. * * @return array */ public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, ], 'price' => [ 'required' => true, 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => 'Float', ], ], ], ]; } } We have a lot of new things here! First, notice how the brand element is added: we specify it to be of type Application\\Form\\BrandFieldset . This is how you handle a 1:1 relationship. When the form is validated, the BrandFieldset will first be populated, and will return a Brand entity (as we have specified a ClassMethods hydrator, and bound the fieldset to a Brand entity using the setObject() method). This Brand entity will then be used to populate the Product entity by calling the setBrand() method. The next element shows you how to handle 1:N relationships. The type is Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , which is a specialized element to handle such cases. As you can see, the name of the element (\"categories\") perfectly matches the name of the property in the Product entity. This element has a few interesting options: count : this is how many times the element (in this case, a category) has to be rendered. We've set it to 2 in this example. should_create_template : if set to true , it will generate a template markup in a <span> element, in order to simplify adding new element on the fly (we will speak about this one later). allow_add : if set to true (which is the default), dynamically added elements will be retrieved and validated; otherwise, they will be completely ignored. This, of course, depends on what you want to do. target_element : this is either an element or, as this is the case in this example, an array that describes the element or fieldset that will be used in the collection. In this case, the target_element is a Category fieldset.","title":"Creating Fieldsets"},{"location":"collections/#the-form-element","text":"So far, so good. We now have our fieldsets in place.

Notice the use_as_base_fieldset option. This option is here to say to the form: \"hey, the object I bind to you is, in fact, bound to the fieldset that is the base fieldset.\" This will be to true in most situations. This approach allows each entity to have its own Fieldset , and enables re-use.

See the PUT Method Support in the PHP documentation for more information. Basic Example Handling file uploads is essentially the same as how you would use Laminas\\Form for form processing, but with some slight caveats that will be described below. In this example we will: Define a Form for backend validation and filtering. Create a view template with a <form> containing a file input. Process the form within a Controller action (laminas-mvc) or in a Request Handler (Mezzio). The Form and InputFilter Here we define a Laminas\\Form\\Element\\File input in a Form extension named UploadForm . use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class UploadForm extends Form { public function __construct($name = null, $options = []) { parent::__construct($name, $options); $this->addElements(); } public function addElements() { // File Input $file = new Element\\File('image-file'); $file->setLabel('Avatar Image Upload'); $file->setAttribute('id', 'image-file'); $this->add($file); } } The File element provides several automated features: The form's enctype will automatically be set to multipart/form-data when the form's prepare() method is called. The file element's default input specification will create the correct Input type: Laminas\\InputFilter\\FileInput . The FileInput will automatically prepend an UploadFile validator to securely validate that the file is actually an uploaded file, and to report any upload errors to the user. The View Template In the view template, we render the <form> , a file input (with label and errors), and a submit button. <!-- File: upload-form.phtml --> <?php $form->prepare(); // The correct enctype is set here $fileElement = $form->get('image-file'); echo $this->form()->openTag($form); ?> <div class=\"form-element\"> <?= $this->formLabel($fileElement) ?> <?= $this->formFile($fileElement) ?> <?= $this->formElementErrors($fileElement) ?> </div> <button>Submit</button> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> When rendered, the HTML should look similar to: <form name=\"upload-form\" id=\"upload-form\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"> <div class=\"form-element\"> <label for=\"image-file\">Avatar Image Upload</label> <input type=\"file\" name=\"image-file\" id=\"image-file\"> </div> <button>Submit</button> </form> The Controller Action When using laminas-mvc, the final step will be to instantiate the UploadForm and process any postbacks in a controller action. The form processing in the controller action will be similar to normal forms, except that you must merge the $_FILES information in the request with the other post data. public function uploadFormAction() { $form = new UploadForm('upload-form'); $request = $this->getRequest(); if ($request->isPost()) { // Make certain to merge the $_FILES info! $post = array_merge_recursive( $request->getPost()->toArray(), $request->getFiles()->toArray() ); $form->setData($post); if ($form->isValid()) { $data = $form->getData(); // Form is valid, save the form! return $this->redirect()->toRoute('upload-form/success'); } } return ['form' => $form]; } Upon a successful file upload, $form->getData() would return: array(1) { [\"image-file\"] => array(5) { [\"name\"] => string(11) \"myimage.png\" [\"type\"] => string(9) \"image/png\" [\"tmp_name\"] => string(22) \"/private/tmp/phpgRXd58\" [\"error\"] => int(0) [\"size\"] => int(14908679) } } Using nested array notation for uploads It is suggested that you always use the Laminas\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Request object to retrieve and merge the $_FILES information with the form, instead of using $_FILES directly, due to how the file information is mapped in the $_FILES array: $$$$FENCED_CODE_BLOCK_5e72a3774a6602.02937997 Laminas\\InputFilter\\FileInput expects the file data be in this re-mapped array format. Note: PSR-7 also remaps the $_FILES array in this way. Mezzio Request Handler If you are using a PSR-15 request handler with PSR-7 request payload, the final step involves merging $request->getParsedBody() with $request->getUploadedFiles() . public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request) : ResponseInterface { $form = new UploadForm('upload-form'); if ($request->getMethod() === 'POST') { $post = array_merge_recursive( $request->getParsedBody(), $request->getUploadedFiles() ); $form->setData($post); if ($form->isValid()) { $data = $form->getData(); // Form is valid, save the form! return new RedirectResponse('upload-form/success'); } } return new HtmlResponse( $this->template->render('app::page-template', [ 'form' => $form, ]); ); } Upon a successful file upload, $form->getData() would return array including the file field name as a key, and a new instance of UploadedFileInterface as its value. Further operations on the uploaded file After running isValid() on the form instance, you should no longer trust the UploadedFileInterface instance stored in the PSR-7 $request to perform further operations on the uploaded file. The file may be moved by one of the filters attached to form input, but since the request is immutable, the change will not be reflected in it. Therefore, after validation, always use the file information retrieved from $form->getData() , not from $request->getUploadedFiles() . File Post-Redirect-Get Plugin When using other standard form inputs (i.e. text , checkbox , select , etc.) along with file inputs in a form, you can encounter a situation where some inputs may become invalid and the user must re-select the file and re-upload. PHP will delete uploaded files from the temporary directory at the end of the request if it has not been moved away or renamed. Re-uploading a valid file each time another form input is invalid is inefficient and annoying to users. One strategy to get around this is to split the form into multiple forms. One form for the file upload inputs and another for the other standard inputs. When you cannot separate the forms, the File Post-Redirect-Get Plugin can be used to manage the file inputs and save off valid uploads until the entire form is valid. Changing our earlier example to use the fileprg() plugin will require two changes. RenameUpload filter First, we need to add a RenameUpload filter to our form's file input, with details on where the valid files should be stored: use Laminas\\InputFilter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class UploadForm extends Form { public function __construct($name = null, $options = []) { parent::__construct($name, $options); $this->addElements(); $this->addInputFilter(); } public function addElements() { // File Input $file = new Element\\File('image-file'); $file->setLabel('Avatar Image Upload') $file->setAttribute('id', 'image-file'); $this->add($file); } public function addInputFilter() { $inputFilter = new InputFilter\\InputFilter(); // File Input $fileInput = new InputFilter\\FileInput('image-file'); $fileInput->setRequired(true); $fileInput->getFilterChain()->attachByName( 'filerenameupload', [ 'target' => './data/tmpuploads/avatar.png', 'randomize' => true, ] ); $inputFilter->add($fileInput); $this->setInputFilter($inputFilter); } } The filerenameupload options above would cause an uploaded file to be renamed and moved to: ./data/tmpuploads/avatar_4b3403665fea6.png . See the RenameUpload filter documentation for more information on its supported options. Further operations on the uploaded file If the file is coming in as a PSR-7 payload, the move operation will be performed on the passed UploadedFileInterface instance. Therefore, it will contain an expired stream and outdated target file name. After running this filter, do not use the request object to get further details about the uploaded file; use the new instance of UploadedFileInterface returned from the filter invocation. Call the fileprg plugin Next, we need to update our controller action to use the fileprg plugin: public function uploadFormAction() { $form = new UploadForm('upload-form'); $tempFile = null; $prg = $this->fileprg($form); if ($prg instanceof \\Laminas\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response) { return $prg; // Return PRG redirect response } if (is_array($prg)) { if ($form->isValid()) { $data = $form->getData(); // Form is valid, save the form! return $this->redirect()->toRoute('upload-form/success'); } // Form not valid, but file uploads might be valid... // Get the temporary file information to show the user in the view $fileErrors = $form->get('image-file')->getMessages(); if (empty($fileErrors)) { $tempFile = $form->get('image-file')->getValue(); } } return [ 'form' => $form, 'tempFile' => $tempFile, ]; } Behind the scenes, the FilePRG plugin will: Run the Form's filters, namely the RenameUpload filter, to move the files out of temporary storage. Store the valid POST data in the session across requests. Change the required flag of any file inputs that had valid uploads to false . This is so that form re-submissions without uploads will not cause validation errors. User notifications In the case of a partially valid form, it is up to the developer whether to notify the user that files have been uploaded or not. For example, you may wish to hide the form input and/or display the file information. These things would be implementation details in the view or in a custom view helper. Just note that neither the FilePRG plugin nor the formFile view helper will do any automatic notifications or view changes when files have been successfully uploaded. HTML5 Multi-File Uploads With HTML5, we are able to select multiple files from a single file input using the multiple attribute. Not all browsers support multiple file uploads , but the file input will safely remain a single file upload for those browsers that do not support the feature. To enable multiple file uploads in laminas-form, set the file element's multiple attribute to true: use Laminas\\InputFilter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class UploadForm extends Form { public function __construct($name = null, $options = []) { parent::__construct($name, $options); $this->addElements(); $this->addInputFilter(); } public function addElements() { // File Input $file = new Element\\File('image-file'); $file->setLabel('Avatar Image Upload'); $file->setAttribute('id', 'image-file'); $file->setAttribute('multiple', true); // Marking as multiple $this->add($file); } public function addInputFilter() { $inputFilter = new InputFilter\\InputFilter(); // File Input $fileInput = new InputFilter\\FileInput('image-file'); $fileInput->setRequired(true); // Define validators and filters as if only one file was being uploaded. // All files will be run through the same validators and filters // automatically. $fileInput->getValidatorChain() ->attachByName('filesize', ['max' => 204800]) ->attachByName('filemimetype', ['mimeType' => 'image/png,image/x-png']) ->attachByName('fileimagesize', ['maxWidth' => 100, 'maxHeight' => 100]); // All files will be renamed, e.g.: // ./data/tmpuploads/avatar_4b3403665fea6.png, // ./data/tmpuploads/avatar_5c45147660fb7.png $fileInput->getFilterChain()->attachByName( 'filerenameupload', [ 'target' => './data/tmpuploads/avatar.png', 'randomize' => true, ] ); $inputFilter->add($fileInput); $this->setInputFilter($inputFilter); } } You do not need to do anything special with the validators and filters to support multiple file uploads. All of the files that are uploaded will have the same validators and filters run against them automatically (from logic within FileInput ). Define them as if a single file was being uploaded. Upload Progress While pure client-based upload progress meters are starting to become available with HTML5's Progress Events , not all browsers have XMLHttpRequest level 2 support . For upload progress to work in a greater number of browsers (IE9 and below), you must use a server-side progress solution. Laminas\\ProgressBar\\Upload provides handlers that can give you the actual state of a file upload in progress. To use this feature, you need to choose one of the Upload Progress Handlers (APC, uploadprogress, or Session) and ensure that your server setup has the appropriate extension or feature enabled. Verify your php.ini session.upload settings before you begin: file_uploads = On post_max_size = 50M upload_max_filesize = 50M session.upload_progress.enabled = On session.upload_progress.freq = \"1%\" session.upload_progress.min_freq = \"1\" ; Also make certain 'upload_tmp_dir' is writable When uploading a file with a form POST, you must also include the progress identifier in a hidden input. The file upload progress view helpers provides a convenient way to add the hidden input based on your handler type. <!-- File: upload-form.phtml --> <?php $fileElement = $form->get('image-file'); $form->prepare(); echo $this->form()->openTag($form); echo $this->formFileSessionProgress(); // Must come before the file input! ?> <div class=\"form-element\"> <?= $this->formLabel($fileElement) ?> <?= $this->formFile($fileElement) ?> <?= $this->formElementErrors($fileElement) ?> </div> <button>Submit</button> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> When rendered, the HTML should look similar to: <form name=\"upload-form\" id=\"upload-form\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"> <input type=\"hidden\" id=\"progress_key\" name=\"PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS\" value=\"12345abcde\"> <div class=\"form-element\"> <label for=\"image-file\">Avatar Image Upload</label> <input type=\"file\" name=\"image-file\" id=\"image-file\"> </div> <button>Submit</button> </form> There are a few different methods for getting progress information to the browser (long vs. short polling). Here we will use short polling since it is simpler and less taxing on server resources, though keep in mind it is not as responsive as long polling. When our form is submitted via AJAX, the browser will continuously poll the server for upload progress. The following is an example controller action which provides the progress information: public function uploadProgressAction() { $id = $this->params()->fromQuery('id', null); $progress = new \\Laminas\\ProgressBar\\Upload\\SessionProgress(); return new \\Laminas\\View\\Model\\JsonModel($progress->getProgress($id)); } // Returns JSON //{ // \"total\" : 204800, // \"current\" : 10240, // \"rate\" : 1024, // \"message\" : \"10kB / 200kB\", // \"done\" : false //} Performance overhead This is not the most efficient way of providing upload progress, since each polling request must go through the Laminas bootstrap process. A better example would be to use a standalone php file in the public folder that bypasses the MVC bootstrapping and only uses the essential Laminas\\ProgressBar adapters. Back in our view template, we will add Javascript to perform the AJAX POST of the form data, and to start a timeout interval for the progress polling. To keep the example code relatively short, we are using the jQuery Form plugin to do the AJAX form POST. If your project uses a different JavaScript framework (or none at all), this will hopefully at least illustrate the necessary high-level logic that would need to be performed. <?php // File: upload-form.phtml // ...after the form... ?> <!-- Twitter Bootstrap progress bar styles: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#progress --> <div id=\"progress\" class=\"help-block\"> <div class=\"progress progress-info progress-striped\"> <div class=\"bar\"></div> </div> <p></p> </div> <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js\"></script> <script src=\"/js/jquery.form.js\"></script> <script> var progressInterval; function getProgress() { // Poll our controller action with the progress id var url = '/upload-form/upload-progress?id=' + $('#progress_key').val(); $.getJSON(url, function(data) { if (data.status && !data.status.done) { var value = Math.floor((data.status.current / data.status.total) * 100); showProgress(value, 'Uploading...'); } else { showProgress(100, 'Complete!'); clearInterval(progressInterval); } }); } function startProgress() { showProgress(0, 'Starting upload...'); progressInterval = setInterval(getProgress, 900); } function showProgress(amount, message) { $('#progress').show(); $('#progress .bar').width(amount + '%'); $('#progress > p').html(message); if (amount < 100) { $('#progress .progress') .addClass('progress-info active') .removeClass('progress-success'); } else { $('#progress .progress') .removeClass('progress-info active') .addClass('progress-success'); } } $(function() { // Register a 'submit' event listener on the form to perform the AJAX POST $('#upload-form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); if ($('#image-file').val() == '') { // No files selected, abort return; } // Perform the submit //$.fn.ajaxSubmit.debug = true; $(this).ajaxSubmit({ beforeSubmit: function(arr, $form, options) { // Notify backend that submit is via ajax arr.push({ name: \"isAjax\", value: \"1\" }); }, success: function (response, statusText, xhr, $form) { clearInterval(progressInterval); showProgress(100, 'Complete!'); // TODO: You'll need to do some custom logic here to handle a successful // form post, and when the form is invalid with validation errors. if (response.status) { // TODO: Do something with a successful form post, like redirect // window.location.replace(response.redirect); } else { // Clear the file input, otherwise the same file gets re-uploaded // http://stackoverflow.com/a/1043969 var fileInput = $('#image-file'); fileInput.replaceWith( fileInput.val('').clone( true ) ); // TODO: Do something with these errors // showErrors(response.formErrors); } }, error: function(a, b, c) { // NOTE: This callback is *not* called when the form is invalid. // It is called when the browser is unable to initiate or complete the ajax submit. // You will need to handle validation errors in the 'success' callback. console.log(a, b, c); } }); // Start the progress polling startProgress(); }); }); </script> And finally, our controller action can be modified to return form status and validation messages in JSON format if we see the 'isAjax' post parameter (which was set in the JavaScript just before submit): public function uploadFormAction() { $form = new UploadForm('upload-form'); $request = $this->getRequest(); if (! $request->isPost()) { return ['form' => $form]; } // Make certain to merge the files info! $post = array_merge_recursive( $request->getPost()->toArray(), $request->getFiles()->toArray() ); $form->setData($post); if ($form->isValid()) { $data = $form->getData(); // Form is valid, save the form! if (! empty($post['isAjax'])) { return new JsonModel(array( 'status' => true, 'redirect' => $this->url()->fromRoute('upload-form/success'), 'formData' => $data, )); } // Fallback for non-JS clients return $this->redirect()->toRoute('upload-form/success'); } if (! empty($post['isAjax'])) { // Send back failure information via JSON return new JsonModel([ 'status' => false, 'formErrors' => $form->getMessages(), 'formData' => $form->getData(), ]); } return array('form' => $form); } Additional Info Related documentation: Form File Element Form File View Helper List of File Validators List of File Filters File Post-Redirect-Get Controller Plugin Laminas\\InputFilter\\FileInput Upload Progress Handlers Upload Progress View Helpers External resources and blog posts from the community: LaminasFileUploadExamples : A Laminas module with several file upload examples.","title":"File Uploads"},{"location":"file-upload/#file-uploads","text":"laminas-form provides support for file uploading by using features from each of laminas-inputfilter , laminas-validator , laminas-filter , and laminas-progressbar .

At the bare minimum, each element or fieldset requires a name; in most situations, you'll also provide some attributes to hint to the view layer how it might render the item. The form itself generally composes an InputFilter \u2014 which you can also create directly in the form via a factory. Individual elements can hint as to what defaults to use when generating a related input for the input filter. Perform form validation by providing an array of data to the setData() method, and calling the isValid() method. If you want to simplify your work even more, you can bind an object to the form; on successful validation, it will be populated from the validated values.

We'll create two fieldsets, one for the sender information, and another for the message details. // Create the fieldset for sender details: $sender = new Fieldset('sender'); $sender->add($name); $sender->add($email); // Create the fieldset for message details: $details = new Fieldset('details'); $details->add($subject); $details->add($message); $form = new Form('contact'); $form->add($sender); $form->add($details); $form->add($captcha); $form->add($csrf); $form->add($send); This manual approach gives maximum flexibility over form creation; however, it comes at the expense of verbosity. In the next section, we'll look at another approach. Creation via Factory You can create the entire form and input filter at once using the Factory . This is particularly nice if you want to store your forms as pure configuration; you can then pass the configuration to the factory and be done. use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Factory; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializable; $factory = new Factory(); $form = $factory->createForm([ 'hydrator' => ArraySerializable::class, 'elements' => [ [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your name', ], 'type' => 'Text', ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Email::class, 'name' => 'email', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your email address', ] ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'subject', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Subject', ], 'type' => 'Text', ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Textarea::class, 'name' => 'message', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Message', ] ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Captcha::class, 'name' => 'captcha', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please verify you are human.', 'captcha' => [ 'class' => 'Dumb', ], ], ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Csrf::class, 'name' => 'security', ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'send', 'type' => 'Submit', 'attributes' => [ 'value' => 'Submit', ], ], ], ], /* If we had fieldsets, they'd go here; fieldsets contain * \"elements\" and \"fieldsets\" keys, and potentially a \"type\" * key indicating the specific FieldsetInterface * implementation to use. 'fieldsets' => [ ], */ // Configuration to pass on to // Laminas\\InputFilter\\Factory::createInputFilter() 'input_filter' => [ /* ... */ ], ]); If we wanted to use fieldsets, as we demonstrated in the previous example, we could do the following: use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Factory; use Laminas\\Hydrator\\ArraySerializable; $factory = new Factory(); $form = $factory->createForm([ 'hydrator' => ArraySerializable::class, // Top-level fieldsets to define: 'fieldsets' => [ [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'sender', 'elements' => [ [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your name', ], 'type' => 'Text' ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Email::class, 'name' => 'email', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your email address', ], ], ], ], ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'details', 'elements' => [ [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'subject', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Subject', ], 'type' => 'Text', ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'message', 'type' => Element\\Textarea::class, 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Message', ], ], ], ], ], ], ], // You can specify an \"elements\" key explicitly: 'elements' => [ [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Captcha::class, 'name' => 'captcha', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please verify you are human.', 'captcha' => [ 'class' => 'Dumb', ], ], ], ], [ 'spec' => [ 'type' => Element\\Csrf::class, 'name' => 'security', ], ], // But entries without string keys are also considered elements: [ 'spec' => [ 'name' => 'send', 'type' => 'Submit', 'attributes' => [ 'value' => 'Submit', ], ], ], // Configuration to pass on to // Laminas\\InputFilter\\Factory::createInputFilter() 'input_filter' => [ /* ... */ ], ]); Note that the chief difference is nesting; otherwise, the information is basically the same. The chief benefits to using the Factory are allowing you to store definitions in configuration, and usage of significant whitespace. Factory-backed Form Extension The default Form implementation is backed by the Factory . This allows you to extend it, and define your form internally. This has the benefit of allowing a mixture of programmatic and factory-backed creation, as well as defining a form for re-use in your application. namespace Contact; use Laminas\\Captcha\\AdapterInterface as CaptchaAdapter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Form\\Form; class ContactForm extends Form { protected $captcha; public function __construct(CaptchaAdapter $captcha) { parent::__construct(); $this->captcha = $captcha; // add() can take an Element/Fieldset instance, or a specification, from // which the appropriate object will be built. $this->add([ 'name' => 'name', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your name', ], 'type' => 'Text', ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Email::class, 'name' => 'email', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Your email address', ], ]); $this->add([ 'name' => 'subject', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Subject', ], 'type' => 'Text', ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Textarea::class, 'name' => 'message', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Message', ], ]); $this->add([ 'type' => Element\\Captcha::class, 'name' => 'captcha', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'Please verify you are human.', 'captcha' => $this->captcha, ], ]); $this->add(new Element\\Csrf('security')); $this->add([ 'name' => 'send', 'type' => 'Submit', 'attributes' => [ 'value' => 'Submit', ], ]); // We could also define the input filter here, or // lazy-create it in the getInputFilter() method. } } In the above example, elements are added in the constructor. This is done to allow altering and/or configuring either the form or input filter factory instances, which could then have bearing on how elements, inputs, etc. are created. In this case, it also allows injection of the CAPTCHA adapter, allowing us to configure it elsewhere in our application and inject it into the form. Validating Forms Validating forms requires three steps. First, the form must have an input filter attached. Second, you must inject the data to validate into the form. Third, you validate the form. If invalid, you can retrieve the error messages, if any. // assuming $captcha is an instance of some Laminas\\Captcha\\AdapterInterface: $form = new Contact\\ContactForm($captcha); // If the form doesn't define an input filter by default, inject one. $form->setInputFilter(new Contact\\ContactFilter()); // Get the data. In an MVC application, you might try: $data = $request->getPost(); // for POST data $data = $request->getQuery(); // for GET (or query string) data $form->setData($data); // Validate the form if ($form->isValid()) { $validatedData = $form->getData(); } else { $messages = $form->getMessages(); } Always populate select elements with options Always ensure that options for a select element are populated prior to validation; otherwise, the element will fail validation, and you will receive a NotInArray error message. If you are populating the options from a database or other data source, make sure this is done prior to validation. Alternately, you may disable the InArray validator programmatically prior to validation: $$$$FENCED_CODE_BLOCK_5e72a3774bfa50.88673636 You can get the raw data if you want, by accessing the composed input filter. $filter = $form->getInputFilter(); $rawValues = $filter->getRawValues(); $nameRawValue = $filter->getRawValue('name'); Hinting to the Input Filter Often, you'll create elements that you expect to behave in the same way on each usage, and for which you'll want specific filters or validation as well. Since the input filter is a separate object, how can you achieve these latter points? Because the default form implementation composes a factory, and the default factory composes an input filter factory, you can have your elements and/or fieldsets hint to the input filter. If no input or input filter is provided in the input filter for that element, these hints will be retrieved and used to create them. To do so, one of the following must occur. For elements, they must implement Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface , which defines a getInputSpecification() method; for fieldsets (and, by extension, forms), they must implement Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface , which defines a getInputFilterSpecification() method. In the case of an element, the getInputSpecification() method should return data to be used by the input filter factory to create an input. Every HTML5 ( email , url , color , etc.) element has a built-in element that uses this logic. For instance, here is how the Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Color element is defined: namespace Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Filter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Validator\\Regex as RegexValidator; use Laminas\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface; class Color extends Element implements InputProviderInterface { /** * Seed attributes * * @var array */ protected $attributes = [ 'type' => 'color', ]; /** * @var ValidatorInterface */ protected $validator; /** * Get validator * * @return ValidatorInterface */ protected function getValidator() { if (null === $this->validator) { $this->validator = new RegexValidator('/^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$/'); } return $this->validator; } /** * Provide default input rules for this element * * Attaches an email validator. * * @return array */ public function getInputSpecification() { return [ 'name' => $this->getName(), 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ['name' => Filter\\StringToLower::class], ], 'validators' => [ $this->getValidator(), ], ]; } } The above hints to the input filter to create and attach an input named after the element, marking it as required, giving it StringTrim and StringToLower filters, and defining a Regex validator. Note that you can either rely on the input filter to create filters and validators, or directly instantiate them. For fieldsets, you do very similarly; the difference is that getInputFilterSpecification() must return configuration for an input filter. namespace Contact\\Form; use Laminas\\Filter; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Validator; class SenderFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ], 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => Validator\\StringLength::class, 'options' => [ 'min' => 3, 'max' => 256 ], ], ], ], 'email' => [ 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ], 'validators' => [ new Validator\\EmailAddress(), ], ], ]; } } Specifications are a great way to make forms, fieldsets, and elements re-usable trivially in your applications. In fact, the Captcha and Csrf elements define specifications in order to ensure they can work without additional user configuration! Use the most specific input type If you set custom input filter specification either in getInputSpecification() or in getInputFilterSpecification() , the Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputInterface set for that specific field is reset to the default Laminas\\InputFilter\\Input . Some form elements may need a particular input filter, like Laminas\\Form\\Element\\File : in this case it's mandatory to specify the type key in your custom specification to match the original one (e.g., for the file element, use Laminas\\InputFilter\\FileInput ). Binding an object As noted in the introduction, forms bridge the domain model and the view layer. Let's see that in action. When you bind() an object to the form, the following happens: The composed Hydrator calls extract() on the object, and uses the values returned, if any, to populate the value attributes of all elements. If a form contains a fieldset that itself contains another fieldset, the form will recursively extract the values. When isValid() is called, if setData() has not been previously set, the form uses the composed Hydrator to extract values from the object, and uses those during validation. If isValid() is successful (and the bindOnValidate flag is enabled, which is true by default), then the Hydrator will be passed the validated values to use to hydrate the bound object. (If you do not want this behavior, call setBindOnValidate(FormInterface::BIND_MANUAL) ). If the object implements Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterAwareInterface , the input filter it composes will be used instead of the one composed on the form. This is easier to understand with an example. $contact = new ArrayObject; $contact['subject'] = '[Contact Form] '; $contact['message'] = 'Type your message here'; $form = new Contact\\ContactForm; $form->bind($contact); // form now has default values for // 'subject' and 'message' $data = [ 'name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'j.doe@example.tld', 'subject' => '[Contact Form] \\'sup?', ]; $form->setData($data); if ($form->isValid()) { // $contact now has the following structure: // [ // 'name' => 'John Doe', // 'email' => 'j.doe@example.tld', // 'subject' => '[Contact Form] \\'sup?', // 'message' => 'Type your message here', // ] // But is an ArrayObject instance! } When an object is bound to the form, calling getData() will return that object by default. If you want to return an associative array instead, you can pass the FormInterface::VALUES_AS_ARRAY flag to the method. use Laminas\\Form\\FormInterface; $data = $form->getData(FormInterface::VALUES_AS_ARRAY); Laminas ships several standard hydrators ; you can create custom hydrators by implementing Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface , which looks like this: namespace Laminas\\Hydrator; interface HydratorInterface { /** @return array */ public function extract($object); public function hydrate(array $data, $object); } Rendering As noted previously, forms are meant to bridge the domain model and view layer. We've discussed the domain model binding, but what about the view? The form component ships a set of form-specific view helpers. These accept the various form objects, and introspect them in order to generate markup. Typically, they will inspect the attributes, but in special cases, they may look at other properties and composed objects. When preparing to render, you will generally want to call prepare() . This method ensures that certain injections are done, and ensures that elements nested in fieldsets and collections generate names in array notation (e.g., scoped[array][notation] ). The base view helpers used everywhere are Form , FormElement , FormLabel , and FormElementErrors . Let's use them to display the contact form. <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Get the form label plugin $formLabel = $this->plugin('formLabel'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); ?> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $name = $form->get('name'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $name->getOption('label'); echo $this->formInput($name); echo $this->formElementErrors($name); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $subject = $form->get('subject'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $subject->getOption('label'); echo $this->formInput($subject); echo $this->formElementErrors($subject); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $message = $form->get('message'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $message->getOption('label'); echo $this->formTextarea($message); echo $this->formElementErrors($message); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $captcha = $form->get('captcha'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $captcha->getOption('label'); echo $this->formCaptcha($captcha); echo $this->formElementErrors($captcha); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('security')) ?> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('send')) ?> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> There are a few things to note about this. First, to prevent confusion in IDEs and editors when syntax highlighting, we use helpers to both open and close the form and label tags. Second, there's a lot of repetition happening here; we could easily create a partial view script or a composite helper to reduce boilerplate. Third, note that not all elements are created equal \u2014 the CSRF and submit elements don't need labels or error messages. Finally, note that the FormElement helper tries to do the right thing \u2014 it delegates actual markup generation to other view helpers. However, it can only guess what specific form helper to delegate to based on the list it has. If you introduce new form view helpers, you'll need to extend the FormElement helper, or create your own. Following the example above, your view files can quickly become long and repetitive to write. While we do not currently provide a single-line form view helper (as this reduces the form customization), we do provide convenience wrappers around emitting individual elements via the FormRow view helper, and collections of elements ( Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset , or Laminas\\Form\\Form ) via the FormCollection view helper (which, internally, iterates the collection and calls FormRow for each element, recursively following collections). The FormRow view helper automatically renders a label (if present), the element itself using the FormElement helper, as well as any errors that could arise. Here is the previous form, rewritten to take advantage of this helper: <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); ?> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('name')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('subject')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('message')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('captcha')) ?> </div> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('security')) ?> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('send')) ?> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> Note that FormRow helper automatically prepends the label. If you want it to be rendered after the element itself, you can pass an optional parameter to the FormRow view helper : <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('name'), 'append') ?> </div> As noted previously, the FormCollection view helper will iterate any collection \u2014 including Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , fieldsets, and forms \u2014 emitting each element discovered using FormRow . FormCollection does not render fieldset or form tags ; you will be responsible for emitting those yourself. The above examples can now be rewritten again: <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); echo $this->formCollection($form); echo $this->form()->closeTag(); Finally, the Form view helper can optionally accept a Laminas\\Form\\Form instance; if provided, it will prepare the form, iterate it, and render all elements using either FormRow (for non-collection elements) or FormCollection (for collections and fieldsets): <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); echo $this->form($form); One important point to note about the last two examples: while they greatly simplifies emitting the form, you also lose most customization opportunities. The above, for example, will not include the <div class=\"form_element\"></div> wrappers from the previous examples! As such, you will generally want to use this facility only when prototyping. Taking advantage of HTML5 input attributes HTML5 brings a lot of exciting features, one of them being simplified client form validations. laminas-form provides elements corresponding to the various HTML5 elements, specifying the client-side attributes required by them. Additionally, each implements InputProviderInterface , ensuring that your input filter will have reasonable default validation and filtering rules that mimic the client-side validations. Always validate server-side Although client validation is nice from a user experience point of view, it must be used in addition to server-side validation, as client validation can be easily bypassed. Validation Groups Sometimes you want to validate only a subset of form elements. As an example, let's say we're re-using our contact form over a web service; in this case, the Csrf , Captcha , and submit button elements are not of interest, and shouldn't be validated. laminas-form provides a proxy method to the underlying InputFilter 's setValidationGroup() method, allowing us to perform this operation. $form->setValidationGroup('name', 'email', 'subject', 'message'); $form->setData($data); if ($form->isValid()) { // Contains only the \"name\", \"email\", \"subject\", and \"message\" values $data = $form->getData(); } If you later want to reset the form to validate all elements, pass the FormInterface::VALIDATE_ALL flag to the setValidationGroup() method: use Laminas\\Form\\FormInterface; $form->setValidationGroup(FormInterface::VALIDATE_ALL); When your form contains nested fieldsets, you can use an array notation to validate only a subset of the fieldsets : $form->setValidationGroup(['profile' => [ 'firstname', 'lastname', ] ]); $form->setData($data); if ($form->isValid()) { // Contains only the \"firstname\" and \"lastname\" values from the // \"profile\" fieldset $data = $form->getData(); } Using Annotations Creating a complete form solution can often be tedious: you'll create a domain model object, an input filter for validating it, a form object for providing a representation for it, and potentially a hydrator for mapping the form elements and fieldsets to the domain model. Wouldn't it be nice to have a central place to define all of these? Annotations allow us to solve this problem. You can define the following behaviors with the shipped annotations in laminas-form: AllowEmpty : mark an input as allowing an empty value. This annotation does not require a value. Attributes : specify the form, fieldset, or element attributes. This annotation requires an associative array of values, in a JSON object format: @Attributes({\"class\":\"laminas_form\",\"type\":\"text\"}) . ComposedObject : specify another object with annotations to parse. Typically, this is used if a property references another object, which will then be added to your form as an additional fieldset. Expects a string value indicating the class for the object being composed: @ComposedObject(\"Namespace\\Model\\ComposedObject\") ; or an array to compose a collection: @ComposedObject({ \"target_object\":\"Namespace\\Model\\ComposedCollection\", \"is_collection\":\"true\", \"options\":{\"count\":2}}) ; target_object is the element to compose, is_collection flags this as a collection, and options can take an array of options to pass into the collection. ErrorMessage : specify the error message to return for an element in the case of a failed validation. Expects a string value. Exclude : mark a property to exclude from the form or fieldset. This annotation does not require a value. Filter : provide a specification for a filter to use on a given element. Expects an associative array of values, with a \"name\" key pointing to a string filter name, and an \"options\" key pointing to an associative array of filter options for the constructor: @Filter({\"name\": \"Boolean\", \"options\": {\"casting\":true}}) . This annotation may be specified multiple times. Flags : flags to pass to the fieldset or form composing an element or fieldset; these are usually used to specify the name or priority. The annotation expects an associative array: @Flags({\"priority\": 100}) . Hydrator : specify the hydrator class to use for this given form or fieldset. A string value is expected. InputFilter : specify the input filter class to use for this given form or fieldset. A string value is expected. Input : specify the input class to use for this given element. A string value is expected. Instance : specify an object class instance to bind to the form or fieldset. Name : specify the name of the current element, fieldset, or form. A string value is expected. Object : specify an object class instance to bind to the form or fieldset. (Note: this is deprecated in 2.4.0; use Instance instead.) Options : options to pass to the fieldset or form that are used to inform behavior \u2014 things that are not attributes; e.g. labels, CAPTCHA adapters, etc. The annotation expects an associative array: @Options({\"label\": \"Username:\"}) . Required : indicate whether an element is required. A boolean value is expected. By default, all elements are required, so this annotation is mainly present to allow disabling a requirement. Type : indicate the class to use for the current element, fieldset, or form. A string value is expected. Validator : provide a specification for a validator to use on a given element. Expects an associative array of values, with a \"name\" key pointing to a string validator name, and an \"options\" key pointing to an associative array of validator options for the constructor: @Validator({\"name\": \"StringLength\", \"options\": {\"min\":3, \"max\": 25}}) . This annotation may be specified multiple times. ContinueIfEmpty : indicate whether the element can be submitted when it is empty. A boolean value is expected. If @Required is set to false , this needs to be set to true to allow the field to be empty. To use annotations, include them in your class and/or property docblocks. Annotation names will be resolved according to the import statements in your class; as such, you can make them as long or as short as you want depending on what you import. doctrine/common dependency Form annotations require doctrine\\common , which contains an annotation parsing engine. Install it using composer: $$$$FENCED_CODE_BLOCK_5e72a3774bfc76.56289380 Here's an example: use Laminas\\Form\\Annotation; /** * @Annotation\\Name(\"user\") * @Annotation\\Hydrator(\"Laminas\\Hydrator\\ObjectProperty\") */ class User { /** * @Annotation\\Exclude() */ public $id; /** * @Annotation\\Filter({\"name\":\"StringTrim\"}) * @Annotation\\Validator({\"name\":\"StringLength\", \"options\":{\"min\":1, \"max\":25}}) * @Annotation\\Validator({\"name\":\"Regex\", \"options\":{\"pattern\":\"/^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]{0,24}$/\"}}) * @Annotation\\Attributes({\"type\":\"text\"}) * @Annotation\\Options({\"label\":\"Username:\"}) */ public $username; /** * @Annotation\\Type(\"Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Email\") * @Annotation\\Options({\"label\":\"Your email address:\"}) */ public $email; } The above will hint to the annotation builder to create a form with name \"user\", which uses the hydrator Laminas\\Hydrator\\ObjectProperty . That form will have two elements, \"username\" and \"email\". The \"username\" element will have an associated input that has a StringTrim filter, and two validators: a StringLength validator indicating the username is between 1 and 25 characters, and a Regex validator asserting it follows a specific accepted pattern. The form element itself will have an attribute \"type\" with value \"text\" (a text element), and a label \"Username:\". The \"email\" element will be of type Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Email , and have the label \"Your email address:\". To use the above, we need Laminas\\Form\\Annotation\\AnnotationBuilder : use Laminas\\Form\\Annotation\\AnnotationBuilder; $builder = new AnnotationBuilder(); $form = $builder->createForm(User::class); At this point, you have a form with the appropriate hydrator attached, an input filter with the appropriate inputs, and all elements. You're not done In all likelihood, you'll need to add some more elements to the form you construct. For example, you'll want a submit button, and likely a CSRF-protection element. We recommend creating a fieldset with common elements such as these that you can then attach to the form you build via annotations.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"quick-start/#quick-start","text":"Forms are composed of elements and fieldsets.

Since the input filter is a separate object, how can you achieve these latter points? Because the default form implementation composes a factory, and the default factory composes an input filter factory, you can have your elements and/or fieldsets hint to the input filter. If no input or input filter is provided in the input filter for that element, these hints will be retrieved and used to create them. To do so, one of the following must occur. For elements, they must implement Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface , which defines a getInputSpecification() method; for fieldsets (and, by extension, forms), they must implement Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface , which defines a getInputFilterSpecification() method. In the case of an element, the getInputSpecification() method should return data to be used by the input filter factory to create an input. Every HTML5 ( email , url , color , etc.) element has a built-in element that uses this logic. For instance, here is how the Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Color element is defined: namespace Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\Filter; use Laminas\\Form\\Element; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Validator\\Regex as RegexValidator; use Laminas\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface; class Color extends Element implements InputProviderInterface { /** * Seed attributes * * @var array */ protected $attributes = [ 'type' => 'color', ]; /** * @var ValidatorInterface */ protected $validator; /** * Get validator * * @return ValidatorInterface */ protected function getValidator() { if (null === $this->validator) { $this->validator = new RegexValidator('/^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$/'); } return $this->validator; } /** * Provide default input rules for this element * * Attaches an email validator. * * @return array */ public function getInputSpecification() { return [ 'name' => $this->getName(), 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ['name' => Filter\\StringToLower::class], ], 'validators' => [ $this->getValidator(), ], ]; } } The above hints to the input filter to create and attach an input named after the element, marking it as required, giving it StringTrim and StringToLower filters, and defining a Regex validator. Note that you can either rely on the input filter to create filters and validators, or directly instantiate them. For fieldsets, you do very similarly; the difference is that getInputFilterSpecification() must return configuration for an input filter. namespace Contact\\Form; use Laminas\\Filter; use Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset; use Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface; use Laminas\\Validator; class SenderFieldset extends Fieldset implements InputFilterProviderInterface { public function getInputFilterSpecification() { return [ 'name' => [ 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ], 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => Validator\\StringLength::class, 'options' => [ 'min' => 3, 'max' => 256 ], ], ], ], 'email' => [ 'required' => true, 'filters' => [ ['name' => Filter\\StringTrim::class], ], 'validators' => [ new Validator\\EmailAddress(), ], ], ]; } } Specifications are a great way to make forms, fieldsets, and elements re-usable trivially in your applications. In fact, the Captcha and Csrf elements define specifications in order to ensure they can work without additional user configuration!","title":"Hinting to the Input Filter"},{"location":"quick-start/#binding-an-object","text":"As noted in the introduction, forms bridge the domain model and the view layer. Let's see that in action. When you bind() an object to the form, the following happens: The composed Hydrator calls extract() on the object, and uses the values returned, if any, to populate the value attributes of all elements. If a form contains a fieldset that itself contains another fieldset, the form will recursively extract the values. When isValid() is called, if setData() has not been previously set, the form uses the composed Hydrator to extract values from the object, and uses those during validation. If isValid() is successful (and the bindOnValidate flag is enabled, which is true by default), then the Hydrator will be passed the validated values to use to hydrate the bound object. (If you do not want this behavior, call setBindOnValidate(FormInterface::BIND_MANUAL) ). If the object implements Laminas\\InputFilter\\InputFilterAwareInterface , the input filter it composes will be used instead of the one composed on the form. This is easier to understand with an example. $contact = new ArrayObject; $contact['subject'] = '[Contact Form] '; $contact['message'] = 'Type your message here'; $form = new Contact\\ContactForm; $form->bind($contact); // form now has default values for // 'subject' and 'message' $data = [ 'name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'j.doe@example.tld', 'subject' => '[Contact Form] \\'sup?', ]; $form->setData($data); if ($form->isValid()) { // $contact now has the following structure: // [ // 'name' => 'John Doe', // 'email' => 'j.doe@example.tld', // 'subject' => '[Contact Form] \\'sup?', // 'message' => 'Type your message here', // ] // But is an ArrayObject instance! } When an object is bound to the form, calling getData() will return that object by default. If you want to return an associative array instead, you can pass the FormInterface::VALUES_AS_ARRAY flag to the method. use Laminas\\Form\\FormInterface; $data = $form->getData(FormInterface::VALUES_AS_ARRAY); Laminas ships several standard hydrators ; you can create custom hydrators by implementing Laminas\\Hydrator\\HydratorInterface , which looks like this: namespace Laminas\\Hydrator; interface HydratorInterface { /** @return array */ public function extract($object); public function hydrate(array $data, $object); }","title":"Binding an object"},{"location":"quick-start/#rendering","text":"As noted previously, forms are meant to bridge the domain model and view layer. We've discussed the domain model binding, but what about the view? The form component ships a set of form-specific view helpers. These accept the various form objects, and introspect them in order to generate markup. Typically, they will inspect the attributes, but in special cases, they may look at other properties and composed objects. When preparing to render, you will generally want to call prepare() . This method ensures that certain injections are done, and ensures that elements nested in fieldsets and collections generate names in array notation (e.g., scoped[array][notation] ). The base view helpers used everywhere are Form , FormElement , FormLabel , and FormElementErrors . Let's use them to display the contact form. <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Get the form label plugin $formLabel = $this->plugin('formLabel'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); ?> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $name = $form->get('name'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $name->getOption('label'); echo $this->formInput($name); echo $this->formElementErrors($name); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $subject = $form->get('subject'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $subject->getOption('label'); echo $this->formInput($subject); echo $this->formElementErrors($subject); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $message = $form->get('message'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $message->getOption('label'); echo $this->formTextarea($message); echo $this->formElementErrors($message); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?php $captcha = $form->get('captcha'); echo $formLabel->openTag() . $captcha->getOption('label'); echo $this->formCaptcha($captcha); echo $this->formElementErrors($captcha); echo $formLabel->closeTag(); ?></div> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('security')) ?> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('send')) ?> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> There are a few things to note about this. First, to prevent confusion in IDEs and editors when syntax highlighting, we use helpers to both open and close the form and label tags. Second, there's a lot of repetition happening here; we could easily create a partial view script or a composite helper to reduce boilerplate. Third, note that not all elements are created equal \u2014 the CSRF and submit elements don't need labels or error messages. Finally, note that the FormElement helper tries to do the right thing \u2014 it delegates actual markup generation to other view helpers. However, it can only guess what specific form helper to delegate to based on the list it has. If you introduce new form view helpers, you'll need to extend the FormElement helper, or create your own. Following the example above, your view files can quickly become long and repetitive to write. While we do not currently provide a single-line form view helper (as this reduces the form customization), we do provide convenience wrappers around emitting individual elements via the FormRow view helper, and collections of elements ( Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , Laminas\\Form\\Fieldset , or Laminas\\Form\\Form ) via the FormCollection view helper (which, internally, iterates the collection and calls FormRow for each element, recursively following collections). The FormRow view helper automatically renders a label (if present), the element itself using the FormElement helper, as well as any errors that could arise. Here is the previous form, rewritten to take advantage of this helper: <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); ?> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('name')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('subject')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('message')) ?> </div> <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('captcha')) ?> </div> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('security')) ?> <?= $this->formElement($form->get('send')) ?> <?= $this->form()->closeTag() ?> Note that FormRow helper automatically prepends the label. If you want it to be rendered after the element itself, you can pass an optional parameter to the FormRow view helper : <div class=\"form_element\"> <?= $this->formRow($form->get('name'), 'append') ?> </div> As noted previously, the FormCollection view helper will iterate any collection \u2014 including Laminas\\Form\\Element\\Collection , fieldsets, and forms \u2014 emitting each element discovered using FormRow . FormCollection does not render fieldset or form tags ; you will be responsible for emitting those yourself. The above examples can now be rewritten again: <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; $form->prepare(); // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); // Render the opening tag echo $this->form()->openTag($form); echo $this->formCollection($form); echo $this->form()->closeTag(); Finally, the Form view helper can optionally accept a Laminas\\Form\\Form instance; if provided, it will prepare the form, iterate it, and render all elements using either FormRow (for non-collection elements) or FormCollection (for collections and fieldsets): <?php // within a view script $form = $this->form; // Assuming the \"contact/process\" route exists... $form->setAttribute('action', $this->url('contact/process')); // Set the method attribute for the form $form->setAttribute('method', 'post'); echo $this->form($form); One important point to note about the last two examples: while they greatly simplifies emitting the form, you also lose most customization opportunities. The above, for example, will not include the <div class=\"form_element\"></div> wrappers from the previous examples! As such, you will generally want to use this facility only when prototyping.","title":"Rendering"},{"location":"quick-start/#taking-advantage-of-html5-input-attributes","text":"HTML5 brings a lot of exciting features, one of them being simplified client form validations. laminas-form provides elements corresponding to the various HTML5 elements, specifying the client-side attributes required by them.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a central place to define all of these? Annotations allow us to solve this problem. You can define the following behaviors with the shipped annotations in laminas-form: AllowEmpty : mark an input as allowing an empty value. This annotation does not require a value. Attributes : specify the form, fieldset, or element attributes. This annotation requires an associative array of values, in a JSON object format: @Attributes({\"class\":\"laminas_form\",\"type\":\"text\"}) . ComposedObject : specify another object with annotations to parse. Typically, this is used if a property references another object, which will then be added to your form as an additional fieldset. Expects a string value indicating the class for the object being composed: @ComposedObject(\"Namespace\\Model\\ComposedObject\") ; or an array to compose a collection: @ComposedObject({ \"target_object\":\"Namespace\\Model\\ComposedCollection\", \"is_collection\":\"true\", \"options\":{\"count\":2}}) ; target_object is the element to compose, is_collection flags this as a collection, and options can take an array of options to pass into the collection. ErrorMessage : specify the error message to return for an element in the case of a failed validation. Expects a string value. Exclude : mark a property to exclude from the form or fieldset. This annotation does not require a value. Filter : provide a specification for a filter to use on a given element. Expects an associative array of values, with a \"name\" key pointing to a string filter name, and an \"options\" key pointing to an associative array of filter options for the constructor: @Filter({\"name\": \"Boolean\", \"options\": {\"casting\":true}}) . This annotation may be specified multiple times. Flags : flags to pass to the fieldset or form composing an element or fieldset; these are usually used to specify the name or priority. The annotation expects an associative array: @Flags({\"priority\": 100}) . Hydrator : specify the hydrator class to use for this given form or fieldset. A string value is expected. InputFilter : specify the input filter class to use for this given form or fieldset. A string value is expected. Input : specify the input class to use for this given element. A string value is expected. Instance : specify an object class instance to bind to the form or fieldset. Name : specify the name of the current element, fieldset, or form. A string value is expected. Object : specify an object class instance to bind to the form or fieldset. (Note: this is deprecated in 2.4.0; use Instance instead.) Options : options to pass to the fieldset or form that are used to inform behavior \u2014 things that are not attributes; e.g. labels, CAPTCHA adapters, etc. The annotation expects an associative array: @Options({\"label\": \"Username:\"}) . Required : indicate whether an element is required. A boolean value is expected. By default, all elements are required, so this annotation is mainly present to allow disabling a requirement. Type : indicate the class to use for the current element, fieldset, or form. A string value is expected. Validator : provide a specification for a validator to use on a given element. Expects an associative array of values, with a \"name\" key pointing to a string validator name, and an \"options\" key pointing to an associative array of validator options for the constructor: @Validator({\"name\": \"StringLength\", \"options\": {\"min\":3, \"max\": 25}}) . This annotation may be specified multiple times. ContinueIfEmpty : indicate whether the element can be submitted when it is empty. A boolean value is expected. If @Required is set to false , this needs to be set to true to allow the field to be empty. To use annotations, include them in your class and/or property docblocks.
